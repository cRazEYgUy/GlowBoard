GlowBoard
===================
An open source, better, customizable alternative to ActiveBoard.

Other names include:
- HolyBoard

- ActiveBoard(2,++)
- A U X O 3

Features:
- White glow on running apps (takes precedence over badge glow)
- Red glow on apps with a badge/notification

Conflicts with BounceNotify, although implements same features.
